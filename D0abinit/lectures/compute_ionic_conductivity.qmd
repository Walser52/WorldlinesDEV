This guide walks you through the key concepts and computational methods used to evaluate **ionic conductivity** in molecular materials, such as organic conductors, polymer electrolytes, and metal-organic frameworks.

## 1. Understanding Ionic Conductivity

Ionic conductivity $\sigma$ is governed by the **Nernst-Einstein relation**:

$$
\sigma = \frac{n q^2 D}{k_B T}
$$

Where:

- \( n \) = charge carrier concentration  
- \( q \) = ionic charge  
- \( D \) = diffusion coefficient  
- \( k_B \) = Boltzmann constant  
- \( T \) = temperature  

Thus the goal is to maximize \( D \) and \( n \) for high conductivity.


## 2. Computational Methods

Multiple approaches may be taken.

### A. Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD)

- Use **DFT-based molecular dynamics** (e.g., VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, CP2K).
- Simulate at **300–800 K** for ~20–100 ps.
- Analyze **mean squared displacement (MSD)** to extract diffusion:

$$
D = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{1}{6t} \langle |r_i(t) - r_i(0)|^2 \rangle
$$

- Estimate $\sigma$ using the Nernst-Einstein equation.

---

### B. Nudged Elastic Band (NEB)

- Calculate **ion migration energy barriers** between stable sites.
- Use to extract **activation energy \( E_a \)**:

$$
\sigma(T) \propto e^{-E_a/k_BT}
$$

Useful for understanding **temperature dependence** of ionic conductivity.

### C. Classical Molecular Dynamics

- Ideal for **larger systems** or **longer time simulations**.
- Suitable for:
  - Polymer electrolytes
  - Liquid electrolytes
- Use force fields like **GAFF**, **CHARMM**, or **OPLS-AA**.

---

### D. Static DFT Analysis

- Perform:
  - Geometry optimization
  - Charge density analysis (Bader, ELF, Voronoi)

Helps identify:
- Preferred ion sites
- Binding strength
- Possible migration paths

## 3. Workflow Example

**Goal:** Evaluate **Li⁺ conductivity** in an organic host

1. Build the structure (Li-doped molecular system).
2. Relax geometry using DFT (e.g., PBE or optB88-vdW).
3. Run AIMD at 300–600 K for ~20–50 ps.
4. Extract MSD and compute diffusion coefficient \( D \).
5. Calculate ionic conductivity \( \sigma \).
6. *(Optional)* Use NEB to estimate migration barrier and predict behavior over temperature.

---

## 4. What You Need

- A realistic structural model (crystal, amorphous, or polymeric).
- Correct ion environment (e.g., solvation shell or coordinating ligands).
- Use **DFT+U** for TM-containing systems.
- Consider **thermal effects** in AIMD or phonon calculations.

---

## 5. Comparison to Experiment

- Compare to **AC impedance spectroscopy** data.
- Analyze **ionic transference number** to isolate ionic from electronic conductivity.
- Match **activation energy** from NEB with **Arrhenius slope** from experiments.
