title: Practice Questions
---

Kreyszig is limited in terms of practice questions and some of you have asked for alternatives. 

Two books you can use to circumvent that are:

- Dennis G. Zill's Advanced Engineering Mathematics
- Dean G. Duffy's Advanced Engineering Mathematics

Zill's book in particular has a lot of practice problems. 

Notwithstanding, you can use `julia` to create your own problems. All you need is a way to create a matrix. 

The following creates a 4x3 matrix with numbers randomly filled from 1 to 10. 
```{julia}
mat = rand(1:10, 4, 3)
```

You can make changes to it and generate as many questions as you want.
